/**
 * Public, unauthenticated self-registration: a self-hosted server obtains its
 * own per-server key with no maintainer involvement.
 *
 * One active key per IP: registering from an IP that already holds a key
 * invalidates the previous one, so a server that loses its key file can simply
 * re-register. That bounds only *concurrent* keys per IP, so it is paired with a
 * per-IP minute-tier rate limit (REGISTER_RATE_LIMITER) on top of the per-key
 * rolling limits and the REGISTRATION_ENABLED kill-switch.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than implied: an IP is not an identity. Two
 * self-hosters behind one CGNAT address take each other's key away by
 * registering, and one actor with many addresses accumulates many permanent
 * keys. Neither is fixed here, because both need a durable identity this
 * endpoint does not have — an invite code, an operator approval step, or a
 * credential that survives an address change — and inventing one silently
 * inside the registration path would be worse than the gap.
 *
 * What IS bounded, as of RELAY_DAILY_BUDGET (see checkDailyBudget), is the thing
 * the accumulation was worth doing: the relay's total spend against the
 * operator's provider quota is now one shared daily counter, so extra keys no
 * longer buy extra budget. The remaining exposure from key accumulation is
 * denial-of-service against that shared pool, not unbounded provider cost.
 *
 * The CGNAT collision has no mitigation here at all. An operator running a relay
 * for users who may share an address should keep REGISTRATION_ENABLED off and
 * issue keys out of band.
 *
 * "One" is enforced by the IP's RelayCoordinator, not by a KV read followed by a
 * KV write. As four separate KV operations — look up the prior key, revoke it,
 * mint, index — concurrent registrations from one address interleaved into
 * several permanent active keys, which is the quota abuse the invariant exists
 * to prevent. The coordinator swaps the IP's current key and returns the one it
 * displaced in a single serialized turn, so racing registrations form a chain
 * where each revokes its predecessor.
 *
 * That chain is claim-then-COMMIT, not claim alone. Minting happens outside the
 * coordinator's turn, and the swap by itself left this hole:
 *
 *   1. A claims the IP and stalls before minting.
 *   2. B claims it, is handed A as its predecessor, mints, and revokes A —
 *      which does nothing, because A's key record does not exist yet.
 *   3. A resumes and mints. Two permanently active keys for one IP, and the
 *      revoke that was supposed to prevent it has already run.
 *
 * So after minting, every registration asks the coordinator whether it is still
 * the IP's current registration (confirmRegistrationIp). A registration that was
 * displaced while minting deletes the key it just made and hands out nothing —
 * it is the only party that still can, since its successor already looked and
 * found nothing there. Exactly one key survives any interleaving.
