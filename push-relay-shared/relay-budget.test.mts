/**
 * A ceiling on what the whole relay can spend in a day.
 *
 * The per-minute limiter buckets per key and per registering IP, and the file
 * that defines it says plainly what that leaves open: "a caller who stays under
 * the per-minute cap can sustain it indefinitely, so the minute limit bounds
 * burst rate but not daily volume against someone else's FCM quota." With public
 * registration open, keys are self-issued and an IP is not an identity, so the
 * number of keys one actor can hold is bounded only by the number of addresses
 * they can appear from — and every one of them gets its own per-minute budget.
 *
 * That note names the fix it was waiting for: "use Durable Objects (exact atomic
 * counters, no KV write pressure)". This is that counter. It is aggregate on
 * purpose — a limit that is per-key is one more thing an attacker mints their
 * way around, and the resource being protected (the operator's FCM/APNs quota)
 * is shared, so the limit on it has to be too.
