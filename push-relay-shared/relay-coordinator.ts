/**
 * RelayCoordinator — the strongly-consistent half of the relay's ownership
 * rules, shared by both relay Workers (worker/ and worker-apns/).
 *
 * Two invariants in this relay are check-then-write, and KV cannot hold either
 * of them. KV is eventually consistent: two concurrent requests both read "no
 * owner yet" and both write themselves in as the owner, and the loser's write
 * simply wins or loses by timing.
 *
 *   1. Device-token ownership ("the first key to deliver to a token owns it").
 *      Two relay keys racing the first send to one device token both saw it
 *      unclaimed, so both were allowed through — which is exactly the spoofed-
 *      notification path the pinning exists to close.
 *
 *   2. One active key per registering IP. The prior-key lookup, the revoke, the
 *      mint and the index update were four separate KV operations, so concurrent
 *      /register calls from one address left several permanent active keys.
 *
 * A Durable Object fixes both because every request for one token (or one IP)
 * routes to the same instance by name, and that instance handles them one at a
 * time — the read and the write cannot be interleaved by anyone else. This is
 * the "needs a strongly-consistent store (Durable Object)" that claimTokenForSend
 * previously only documented.
 *
 * Nearly dumb: it stores an owner id plus the bookkeeping that makes releasing a
 * claim safe (see settleToken). Whether an owning key is still *active* is a KV
 * question (the key records live there), so the caller answers it and comes back
 * with a compare-and-swap (`takeoverFrom`) rather than this class reaching into
 * KV. That keeps the serialized section to a couple of storage operations.

   * Aggregate is the point. The per-minute limiters bucket per key and per
   * registering IP, which bounds burst rate but not daily volume — and with
   * public registration open, a caller who wants more buckets simply registers
   * more keys. The resource actually being spent (the operator's FCM/APNs
   * quota) is one shared pool, so the ceiling on it has to be one shared
   * counter, or it is not a ceiling.
   *
   * The counter resets on the UTC day boundary rather than on a rolling window:
   * a rolling window needs the timestamps of every send in it, and this needs
   * two integers. The cost is that a day's budget can be spent in its first
   * minute; the minute limiter is what bounds that shape, and the two together
   * are what the note in push-relay-common.ts asks for.
   *
   * An over-budget call does NOT increment. A rejected caller retrying in a
   * loop would otherwise push the count arbitrarily far past the limit, which
   * changes nothing while the day lasts but makes the counter useless as a
   * report of what was actually spent.
   *
   * The get-then-put below needs no transaction() or blockConcurrencyWhile().
   * It reads like a lost-update race and is reported as one, so: input gates
   * make it safe. While a storage operation is outstanding the runtime delivers
   * no new events to the object, so two concurrent sends cannot both observe
   * the same `used`. Cloudflare's own "Rules of Durable Objects" gives exactly
   * this shape — `const value = await storage.get("count"); await
   * storage.put("count", value + 1)` — as the canonical example of code that is
   * safe because of gating.
   *
   * What breaks that guarantee is non-storage I/O: an `await fetch(...)` between
   * the read and the write opens the gate and lets another request interleave.
   * There is deliberately none here, and adding one would silently reintroduce
   * the race this comment says does not exist. Keep this method storage-only.
