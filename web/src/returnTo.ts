 * sameOriginPath narrows an untrusted `return_to` value to a path on this origin, or null.

 * The value arrives in the query string, so anyone can choose it. Assigning it to
 * `window.location` unchecked is an open redirect that fires immediately after the user
 * types their password on the real sign-on domain, which is exactly the ending a phishing
 * flow wants. `form-action 'self'` in the CSP does not constrain `window.location`.
 *
 * Only a single-slash-prefixed path is accepted. `//evil.tld` and `https://evil.tld` are
 * protocol-relative and absolute URLs respectively, and both leave this origin.
