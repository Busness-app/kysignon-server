/**
 * KySecurity Mobile App push relay — a Cloudflare Worker that delivers APNs push notifications.
 *
 * This Worker delivers native push notifications to iOS devices via Apple Push
 * Notification service (APNs), holding the APNs auth key (.p8) and issuing provider
 * tokens on behalf of KySignOn and KyPassword deployments, each authenticated with
 * its own API key. Self-hosters therefore never need an Apple Developer account at
 * the server level and never recompile the app (only update its APNs device token).
 *
 * Endpoints:
 *   GET    /health          (public)                       -> liveness + config
 *   POST   /register        (public)                       -> self-issue a key
 *   POST   /send            (Bearer <per-server API key>)  -> deliver one push
 *
 * That is the whole surface. There is no admin API: listing and revoking keys
 * is `wrangler kv key` against the API_KEYS namespace (see README), because an
 * always-on bearer-secret endpoint on the public internet is a worse trade than
 * a CLI command the maintainer runs a few times a year.
 *
 * Per-key controls:
 *   - Expiry:        keys may carry an expiresAt; expired keys are rejected.
 *   - Rate limiting: per-minute cap via the native rate-limiting binding (no KV writes).
 *   - Usage:         per-send data points in Analytics Engine (off the KV path).
 *
 * Observability: every request gets a UUID request id, echoed in the X-Request-Id
 * response header and in error bodies, plus one structured JSON access log line.
 *
 * Self-registration, rate limiting, usage analytics, and small crypto/HTTP
 * helpers are shared with the FCM relay (worker/) — see
 * ../../push-relay-shared/push-relay-common.ts.
