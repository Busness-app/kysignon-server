 * `invalid_client`, `unauthorized_client` — and it is the whole diagnostic an
 * operator needs: `invalid_client` is a wrong `FCM_CLIENT_EMAIL`,
 * `invalid_grant` is a bad `FCM_PRIVATE_KEY` or a clock that has drifted.
 * `error_description` is free text from Google and is deliberately dropped.
 *
 * The returned value is checked against a narrow pattern rather than trusted,
 * so this can never become a hole the response body fits through: anything
 * that is not a short lowercase identifier is reported as a placeholder. That
 * is a stronger guarantee than the send path's 200-character clip, and it is
 * cheap here because — unlike FCM's send errors — the useful part of this

/**
 * Whether FCM said this device token is gone.
 *
 * A true here leaves the relay as HTTP 410 and the backend DELETES the device
 * registration (processor/push_dispatch.go). A device row carries that device's
 * authentication secret, not just a push token, so the account loses push 2FA
 * and has to pair again by hand. Nothing on the server side undoes it.
 *
 * The rule is therefore status AND the STRUCTURED reason, never a substring on
 * its own: FCM v1 reports a retired token as HTTP 404 with a
 * `google.firebase.fcm.v1.FcmError` detail whose errorCode is `UNREGISTERED`.
 * Anything else — `INVALID_ARGUMENT` from a token belonging to another Firebase
 * project, `SENDER_ID_MISMATCH`, an auth failure, a proxy's HTML error page
 * that happens to contain the word — is a delivery failure, which costs a retry
 * and a red relay health status instead of a fleet of unpaired devices.
 *
 * An unparseable body at the right status is likewise NOT a verdict. Failing
 * that way means a genuinely dead token goes unpruned and wastes sends until
 * the device is removed some other way, which is the recoverable direction.
 *
 * This mirrors isRelayStaleResponse in processor/native_sender.go, which was
 * narrowed for exactly this reason: matching "four substrings anywhere in an
 * 8 KiB body at any non-2xx status, with nothing tying the response to the token
 * that was sent" handed the upstream far more authority than delivering a
 * notification requires. The same argument applies one hop earlier, here.

/**
 * Send a single push via FCM HTTP v1.
 *
 * **Deliberately carries no top-level `notification` block.** It used to, and
 * that one field was the cause of three separate user-visible bugs on Android.
 *
 * FCM's rule: a message carrying a `notification` payload, delivered to an app
 * that is backgrounded or killed, is rendered by the **system tray** and
 * `FirebaseMessagingService.onMessageReceived` is never called. For the KySecurity
 * Mobile App that would mean:
 *
 *  1. Tapping an approval notification can open the launcher instead of the
 *     app's MFA approval flow.
 *  2. A background-delivered challenge is not available to the app's local MFA
 *     challenge tracker.
 *  3. Notifications can land on a system fallback channel instead of the
 *     app-managed MFA channel.
 *
 * Data-only, so onMessageReceived always runs and the app builds the notification
 * with the right channel, the right tap target, and the tracker entry. That is
 * what `android.priority: "HIGH"` is for: it is what lets a data-only message
 * wake a Doze'd app.
 *
 * This relay is Android-only, and the envelope no longer pretends otherwise. It
 * used to carry an `apns` override, which could not fire: the Go backend's
 * selectSender maps platform ios/macos to the "apns" transport and its separate
 * APNS_RELAY worker, and returns an error rather than falling back to FCM when
 * that relay is unconfigured (see native_sender.go). No Apple device can reach
 * this code path.
 *
 * `message.title`/`message.body` are consequently not forwarded anywhere — that
 * is deliberate, not an oversight. They remain on FcmMessage because the Go
 * backend still posts them, and Android does not need them: buildNativePushData
 * duplicates the same values into `data` when content previews are on, and
 * PushPayloadParser falls back to its own strings when they are off.
